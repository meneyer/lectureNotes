                <p>The CSS style link in the header section was taken from Bootstrap's website</p>

                <p>This is a test paragraph, but it should allow you to see boostrap columns in action!</p>

            <div class="col-md">
                <p>This section is using the "col-md" command.  The "md" stands for medium.  When viewing on a small device, like a phone, Bootstrap will forgo the grid and turn it into a block behavior.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="col-md">
                <p>There is also a small (phones), large (desktops), and extra large (large desktop) option.</p>

            <div class="col-7">
                <p>This is using the "col-7" command.  Bootstrap has 12 slots for a row.  So this is using 7 no matter what you are viewing it on.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="col-5">
               <p>This is using 5 slots.  So all 12 are taken up in this row.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-5">
                <p>This is on the following row as there are no more slots available in the row above.  It is also taking up 5 slots.</p>

            <div class = "col-md-3">
                <p>This is using "col-md-3" It is combining 2 of the options above.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "col-md-3">
                <p>It will get out of the grid behavoir and move to a block style for smaller devices</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "col-md-3">
                <p>However, it is still only using 3 of 12 slots per item for medium and above devices.</p>
